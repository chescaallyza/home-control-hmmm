This project was developed as part of the CPE 331 â€“ Embedded Systems course during my Summer Semester of 2023-2024. The project involved creating a 
home automation system using a custom-built diorama and integrating both Arduino and Raspberry Pi to control and monitor various home functions. 
The system includes lighting and door lock automation, managed via sensors and actuators, with a web interface for user interaction.
